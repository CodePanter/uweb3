# New and improved: µWeb3

Since µWeb inception we have used it for many projects, and while it did its job, there were plenty of rough edges. This new version intends to remove those and pull it into the current age.

# Notable changes

* wsgi complaint interface
* python3 native
* Better handling of strings and automatic escaping
* More options for template engines
* More options for SQL / database engines


## Example projects

The following example applications for newWeb exist:

* [newWeb-info](https://github.com/edelooff/newWeb-info): This demonstrates most µWeb3 features, and gives you examples on how to use most of them.
* [newWeb-logviewer](https://github.com/edelooff/newWeb-logviewer): This allows you to view and search in the logs generated by all µWeb and µWeb3 applications.

# µWeb3 installation

The easiest and quickest way to install µWeb3 is using Python's `virtualenv`. Install using the setuptools installation script, which will automatically gather dependencies.

```bash
# Set up the Python3 virtualenv
python3 -m venv env
source env/bin/activate

# Install uWeb3
python3 setup.py install

# Or you can install in development mode which allows easy modification of the source:
python3 setup.py develop

cd uweb3/scaffold

python3 serve.py
```

## Ubuntu issues
On some ubuntu setups venv is broken and therefore does not install the activation scripts.

```bash
# Set up the Python3 virtualenv on Ubuntu
python3 -m venv--without-pip env
source env/bin/activate
curl https://bootstrap.pypa.io/get-pip.py | python
deactivate
source env/bin/activate

# then proceed to install µWeb3 like before.
```

# µWeb3 database setup

Setting up a database connection with µWeb3 is easy, navigate to the settings.ini file in the scaffold folder and add the following fields to the file:
``` 
[mysql] OR [sqlite]
host = 'host'
user = 'username'
password = 'pass'
database = 'dbname'
```
To access your database connection simply use the connection attribute in any class that inherits from PageMaker.

# Config settings
If you are working on µWeb3 core make sure to enable the following setting in the config:
``` 
[development]
dev = True
```
This makes sure that µWeb3 restarts every time you modify something in the core of the framework aswell.

µWeb3 also has an inbuild protection for XSRF. To make use of it enable the following setting in the config: 
```
[security]
xsrf_enabled = True
```
Now on every request it checks if there is a XSRF cookie in place. If there is no cookie it will create one.
Every post request it will validate the first input field with the tag 'xsrf'. 
If the cookie and the post request match the 'incorrect_xsrf_token' flag will stay on the default(False). 
If however they do not match this flag will be set to True. 
To secure your routes make sure to decorate them with the 'checkxsrf' decorator.

To automaticly generate a hidden input with a xsrf token make use of the {{ xsrf [variable_with_xsrf_token]}} function.
