# New and improved: µWeb3

Since µWeb inception we have used it for many projects, and while it did its job, there were plenty of rough edges. This new version intends to remove those and pull it into the current age.

# Notable changes

* wsgi complaint interface
* python3 native
* Better handling of strings and automatic escaping
* More options for template engines
* More options for SQL / database engines


## Example projects

The following example applications for newWeb exist:

* [newWeb-info](https://github.com/edelooff/newWeb-info): This demonstrates most µWeb3 features, and gives you examples on how to use most of them.
* [newWeb-logviewer](https://github.com/edelooff/newWeb-logviewer): This allows you to view and search in the logs generated by all µWeb and µWeb3 applications.

# µWeb3 installation

The easiest and quickest way to install µWeb3 is using Python's `virtualenv`. Install using the setuptools installation script, which will automatically gather dependencies.

```bash
# Set up the Python3 virtualenv
python3 -m venv env
source env/bin/activate

# Install uWeb3
python3 setup.py install

# Or you can install in development mode which allows easy modification of the source:
python3 setup.py develop

cd uweb3/scaffold

python3 serve.py
```

# µWeb3 database setup

Setting up a database connection with µWeb3 is easy, navigate to the settings.ini file and add your connection attributes as followed:
``` 
[mysql] OR [sqlite]
host = 'host'
user = 'username'
password = 'pass'
database = 'dbname'
```
To get the connection object simply access the self.connection in the pagemaker of your choice


## Ubuntu issues
On some ubuntu setups venv is broken and therefore does not install the activation scripts.

```bash
# Set up the Python3 virtualenv on Ubuntu
python3 -m venv--without-pip env
source env/bin/activate
curl https://bootstrap.pypa.io/get-pip.py | python
deactivate
source env/bin/activate

# then proceed to install µWeb3 like before.
```
